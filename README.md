I couldn't resolve some points as:

4-c.&& 5 "Get in touch" button was not displayed, I clicked on "submit" button instead of

7- All mandatory fields were in red

11- I didn't understand if check e-mail field or the mandatory field, anyways e-mail field was not

Probably I made a mistake with .gitignore file and project could be broken, recomend to create a new one with
scr folder and pom.xml file
